        <h1>High Noon</h1>

        <p>
          My first experience with any kind of game development. High Noon is a tabletop board game that pits four
          players in
          a survival scenario where they must collect resources and build shelter. The project was done as part of
          Shanghai
          American School's Innovation Institute project-based learning program, and is intended to analyze the
          tendencies of
          people to collaborate or compete with others when placed in situations where both outcomes have benefits.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project was a group effort alongside classmates Luca Lee, Leonard Lee, and Tori Li. With respect to team
          responsibilities, I structured the core gameplay loop and came up with most of the game's mechanics.
        </p>

        <p>
          As one can tell, the game and its content are "heavily inspired" by a certain movement shooter that came out
          during
          that time period (please don't sue any of us Blizzard we really liked Overwatch)
        </p>

                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">
                  A group of people wake up in a forest at 6 AM. A note is left for them which reads:
                  "In 6 hours you are all going to die, unless you can build a shelter
                  and be under it by that time. But can you make it?" The note ends.
                  As one of the people, you can choose to work with the others or
                  work against them, The Choice is yours.
                </p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">The Setup:</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">
                  1. The Board is set up with one area on top, one area on the bottom,
                  and one in the middle. The forest area must be at the middle.
                </p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">2. The chance card pile is shuffled and placed next to the
                  board.
                </p>

                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">3. Each player picks a random character car and recieve the
                  player piece for that card.</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">4. After recieving the piece, place it in the middle of the
                  Forest.</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">
                  5. The order of turns is determined by rolling the 8-sided die. The
                  player who rolled the highest goes first. If a tie is made between
                  players, the players roll the die again.
                </p>

                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">The Rules:</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">1. At the start of a turn, the player rolls to determine
                  how much
                  energy they have for that turn.</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">2. At the end of each turn, the player draws a card from
                  the
                  Chance pile. If it is an event, it must be used immediately</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">3. The die used will change as the game progresses, from a
                  4-sided die to a 6-sided die, and an 8-sided die.</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">4. Players may not move diagonally</p>

                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">Mechanics: Energy:</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">Energy is rolled at the start of every turn. It is used
                  when the
                  player wants to perform an action.</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">Actions that use Energy</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">Movement: 1 Energy per space</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">Placing a Wood Block: 1 Energy</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">Placing a Stone Block: 1 Energy</p>
                <p style="font: 16px Bodoni MT;">Placing a Steel Block: 1 Energy</p>

        <h1>Slimland</h1>

        <p>
          What started as a personal project for working with Unity eventually became a small submission to my first
          game jam.
          Slimland is a platformer game where you play as a happy blue slime. This was my first solo game project, done
          with
          the intent of developing skills in all aspects of game development. As such, all assets in this project are
          self-made.
          A short version consisting of two levels was submitted to Devtober 2020, and I have put development for it on
          hiatus
          for now to focus on improving other skills
        </p>

        <p>
          The big final project for my Game Development I course. Project Mindswipe is a stealth game which has players
          sequentially
          break into various locations to steal something, and then break out of those same locations after the item is
          taken. Project
          Mindswipe is my first experience with "proper" video game development, as we created, developed, and
          communicated the game to
          our professor and graders over a specified period of time, before concluding with a presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project was a group effort alongside Drake Miller, Lance Davis, Ram Venkatesh, Dana Ravago and Vinnie
          Colosimo,
          and was created in GameMaker Studio 2. With respect to team responsibilities, I designed each level's rooms and
          room
          mechanics, and wrote the random level generation algorithm to create levels with those rooms.

          Just Ice Served is a 2D infinite runner that tells the story of a snowball throwing vigilante set on ridding

          Just Ice Served was created in Unity for itch.io's 2-Button Jam and was a partner effort with Kyle Liang (Georgia Institute of Technology). 
          Background music for the game was created by Stefan DeBates (Georgia Institute of Technology) and used with permission. 
          I created all the art for the game in Photoshop, and programmed scripts relating to player controls, enemy AI, and cutscene UI.
